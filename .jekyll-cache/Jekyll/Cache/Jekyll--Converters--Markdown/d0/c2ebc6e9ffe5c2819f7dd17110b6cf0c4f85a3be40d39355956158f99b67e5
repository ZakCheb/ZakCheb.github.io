I"6<p>Unix creators set up a design philosophy based around simplicity : specific pieces of software should be built to do <strong>one thing</strong> and do that one thing <strong>well</strong>.
I wanted to toy around ffmpeg and netcat on my free time, and came up with a train pipe that stream the output of the screen, compress it, and encrypt it with Rijndael cypher, its like AES but with 256bit block instead (Yes Iâ€™m extremely paranoid), and finally send it over the network with netcat.
Each block will be explained separately then reassembled at the end.</p>
